[Example App](https://rphansen91.github.io/react-hawk-vs-context-vs-recoil-demo/)

### About

This library is for educational purposes and is **not** intended for production use. 

Concepts were originally introduced by [recoiljs](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil)

This is an attempt to break down the library and reconstruct it.

In the process coming away with a better understanding of the state lifecycle of react. 

### Design Goals

- Lightweight global state management 
- Recompute state only when the state dependency changes
- Re-render components only when the state dependency changes
- A `hawk` or `atom` is a single piece of global state
- A `hawkeye` or `selector` computes a value based on one or more `hawk`s
- `useHawkState` to access current value and subscribes / unsubscribes to the hawk state
- `useHawkSetState` dispatches changes to `hawk`s and `hawkeye`s throughout the application

### Install

```bash
yarn add react-hawk
```

### Usage

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { hawk, hawkeye, useHawkState, useHawkSetState } from 'react-hawk';

const counterState = hawk({
  key: 'counter',
  default: 0
});

const isEvenState = hawkeye({
  key: 'isEven',
  get: ({ get }) => {
    const count = get(counterState)
    return Boolean(count % 2) ? 'odd' : 'even'
  }
})

const useIncrease = () => {
  const setCounter = useHawkSetState(counterState)
  const increase = (n = 1) => {
    setCounter(count => count + n)
  }
  return increase
}

const useDecrease = () => {
  const setCounter = useHawkSetState(counterState)
  const decrease = (n = 1) => {
    setCounter(count => count - n)
  }
  return decrease
}

export const Counter = () => {
  const count = useHawkState(counterState)
  const even = useHawkState(isEvenState)
  const decrease = useDecrease()
  const increase = useIncrease()
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => decrease()}>-</button>
      {count} is {even}
      <button onClick={() => increase()}>+</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
